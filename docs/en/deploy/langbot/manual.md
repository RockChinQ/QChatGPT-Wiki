# Manual Deployment

:::warning
1. Please use Python 3.10.1 (not including 3.10.0) or higher version, 3.10.14 is recommended. You need to install Python if you don't have it.
2. This method is not recommended, manual deployment may not be supported in the future. Please consider using Docker deployment.
:::

## Installing the Main Program

1. Go to the [Release](https://github.com/RockChinQ/LangBot/releases) page to download the latest version of the zip package (recommended) `langbot-xxx-all.zip` (do not download Source Code as it does not include WebUI). Extract it and open a command line (terminal) in the extracted directory.

:::info

You can also use the following commands to clone the latest code (may contain unstable code) and use it:

```bash
# Clone the main repository
git clone https://github.com/RockChinQ/LangBot
cd LangBot
```

If you are in mainland China, you can clone from the [GitCode mirror](https://gitcode.com/RockChinQ/LangBot):

```bash
git clone https://gitcode.com/RockChinQ/LangBot
cd LangBot
```

Then manually build the frontend:

```bash
# Build frontend, requires NodeJS >= 22
cd web
npm install && npm run build
cd ..
```

:::

2. (Recommended) Create a virtual environment

On some Linux systems that use system package managers to manage Python dependencies, dependency conflicts may occur, so please use venv to create a virtual environment. Windows users can skip this step.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or use Tsinghua mirror

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple 
```

4. Run the main program once to generate configuration files

```bash
python main.py
```

You will see the following message:

```
