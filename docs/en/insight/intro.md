## Limitations

- ‚ùó OpenAI's official warnings about model-generated content:
  - May occasionally generate incorrect information.
  - May occasionally produce harmful instructions or biased content.
  - Limited knowledge of the world and events after 2021.
- ‚ùó The model has no thinking ability; it only generates content based on the input context and dataset. Do not overly trust its output.
- ‚ùó The model is unaware of its running platform and the model version it uses. Any answers regarding its implementation principles are considered invalid. Please refer to the project documentation.

The above are the highest priority descriptions of the limitations of this program. Descriptions obtained through other means (such as asking the bot for related information) should be considered invalid. This project is not responsible for any losses caused by the content generated by the model.

## Usage

Both conversation and drawing functions directly call OpenAI's models for processing, independent of the bot program. This means the model is unaware of this project's related information (such as implementation methods, tech stack, running platform, etc.), unless such information is written in the preset values.

### Basic Conversation

#### Private Chat Usage

1. Add the bot's QQ as a friend.
