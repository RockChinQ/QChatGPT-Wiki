# System Operations

## Task List

The task list tracks the progress of time-consuming tasks such as `plugin updates`, `plugin installations`, and `plugin deletions`.  
Click the task list button at the bottom of the sidebar to open the task list dialog, where you can view task execution steps, logs, and other information.

## Hot Reload

Currently, hot reload is supported for the message platform and plugins. Click the corresponding button in the system information section at the bottom of the sidebar to perform a hot reload.  
After modifying the `message platform adapter configuration`, a manual hot reload is required, while plugin changes will trigger an automatic hot reload.
